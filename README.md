## What Is This?

An **interactive timeline** tracking every AI model, product, API, and company that has been:
- 🔴 **Deprecated** — API access removed
- 💀 **Killed** — product shut down entirely
- 🔄 **Rebranded** — renamed and rebuilt (RIP the original)
- 👻 **Abandoned** — left to rot without announcement
- 🏢 **Acqui-hired** — team absorbed, product left as a shell

## Features

- **Grid View** — Browse tombstones for each dead AI product
- **Timeline View** — See deaths chronologically
- **Filter by Type** — Models, Products, APIs, Companies
- **Sort Options** — By death date, lifespan, or alphabetically
- **Detailed Modals** — Full backstory for each entry with lifespan visualizations
- **Dark, Atmospheric Design** — Because graveyards shouldn't be bright

## Notable Entries

| Name | Lifespan | Cause of Death |
|---|---|---|
| **Galactica** (Meta) | 3 days | Public backlash — generated fake science papers |
| **Google Bard** | 10 months | Rebranded to Gemini after error-prone launch |
| **ChatGPT Plugins** | 12 months | Replaced by Custom GPTs (which also died) |
| **GPT-3** | 3.5 years | Deprecated — replaced by GPT-3.5/4 |
| **Stability AI** | 1.5 years | CEO resigned, company restructured |

## Tech Stack

- **Vanilla JavaScript** + **D3.js** — No framework bloat
